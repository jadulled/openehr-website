			<p>The openEHR software program aims to support software development based on, or related to, the openEHR specifications.</p>

			
			<h2>Current Activities</h2>
			<p>Most current openEHR related software projects are self-governed and self-funded by various organisations doing research or commercial services/product development. The <em>openEHR Software Program</em> is an arena for sharing experience and ideas between projects. Most such sharing is currently done via the <a href="mailinglists"> software focused mailing lists</a> and partly also the <a href="/es/programs/specification/mailinglists">specification focused mailing lists</a>.</p>
			<p>The program also coordinates hosting of some software projects that have donated code to openEHR or previously have requested openEHR hosting. More outspoken rules for what is required to host a project under the openEHR "umbrella" and/or to "brand" it as an openEHR project is under discussion in the community. A suggestion is to reuse the project experiences from the Apache Foundation, <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#incubator" target="_blank"> including some incubation process</a> etc. (See also: <a href="iplicense">license preferences</a>.)</p>
			<p>The program strives to increase awareness of available openEHR implementations. A wiki page lists <a href="http://www.openehr.org/wiki/display/projects/" target="_blank">known openEHR-related software projects</a>. Other implementation related information can be found at the <a href="http://www.openehr.org/wiki/display/dev/" target="_blank">developer related wiki-pages</a></p>

			
			<h2>Potential future activities</h2>
			<p>The future direction of the software programme is always open for community discussion (primarily using the <a href="mailinglists">openehr-implementers mail list</a>). Some initial suggestions are:</p> 
			<ul>
				<li>Conformance and interoperability test tools - to be designed and developed together with the openEHR Specifications Programme.</li>
				<li>Clarification of procedures for openEHR hosting and "branding" of open software projects</li>
				<li>Start and maintain a list of "project suggestions" as a service to e.g. educational or commercial actors wanting to explore unfulfilled openEHR software needs.</li>
			</ul>
