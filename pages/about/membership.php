			<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Q: if my employer is an Industry Partner, does that make me an openEHR Individual Member?

						<li>A: No. As an employee of an Industry Partner you can be a member of Program project groups and Editorial Committees but you cannot vote as an Individual Member in Management Board elections or be nominated for a Management Board position. You are, of course, free to register separately as an Individual Member and your employer may pay for your membership, if they wish.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Q: if my employer is an Industry Partner, can I nominate for an Industry Partner position on the Management Board?

				</li>
				<li>Q: do I need to be an openEHR Member to be on the Editorial Committee of one of the oenEHR programs?
